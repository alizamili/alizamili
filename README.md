👋 Hello and welcome to my GitHub account
My name is Ali, and I graduated with a degree in Applied Computer Science specializing in AI
I am deeply passionate about software engineering and problem-solving. For me, writing code is more than just a skill — it’s a way to create, to solve challenges, and to keep learning every single day.

I take pride in always giving my best on every project, approaching problems with creativity, and finding out-of-the-box solutions. I enjoy learning new technologies and applying them in practice right away, which keeps me growing both as a developer and as a person.

With strong collaboration and communication skills, I work well in diverse teams and value knowledge sharing.

You can also find some of my school projects here on my GitHub, showcasing my skills and the work I’ve done during my studies.
